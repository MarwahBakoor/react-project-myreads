# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. This project was created using [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## launch the project

To launch The project right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
